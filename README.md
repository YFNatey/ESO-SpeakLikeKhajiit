# Speak Like Khajiit - An Elder Scrolls Online Addon

## Context for Non-Elder Scrolls Players

This addon addresses a key immersion gap in Elder Scrolls Online. In the game's lore, Khajiit—a race of cat-like humanoids from the desert province of Elsweyr—speak with distinctive linguistic patterns, notably referring to themselves in the third person (e.g., "This one needs help" rather than "I need help"). Despite this rich cultural background, the base game presents all player dialogue options in standard English regardless of your character's race.

As someone passionate about creating deeply immersive gaming experiences, I developed this addon to bridge that gap between lore and gameplay mechanics.

## Features for Players

* **Authentic Khajiit Speech Patterns:** Transform your dialogue options to match true Khajiiti speech
* **Self-Reference Options:** Choose between "this one," your character name, or "Khajiit" as your preferred self-reference style
* **Customizable Personalities:** Adjust formality level, merchant tendency, and moon sugar influence to create your unique Khajiit voice
* **Cyrodiilic Tone Control:** Set how much your Khajiit has adopted Imperial speech patterns for authentic roleplay
* **Automatic Greeting & Farewell Transformation:** Classic Khajiit expressions replace standard greetings
* **Question Style Adaptation:** Questions are phrased in the distinctive Khajiit interrogative style
* **Full Gamepad Support:** Works perfectly with both keyboard/mouse and controller interfaces

## Technical Overview

This addon goes far beyond simple text replacement through a sophisticated linguistic processing system:

* **Complex Pronoun Resolution:** Intelligently handles multiple self-references within single sentences to maintain grammatical coherence
* **Contextual Grammar Adaptation:** Transforms verb conjugations and syntactic structures to match Khajiit speech patterns
* **Personality-Driven Speech:** Implements multiple customizable personality traits that affect formality, merchant tendencies, and other speech characteristics
* **Cultural Speech Variations:** Allows for adjustment between traditional Khajiit speech and more Cyrodiilic (Imperial) influenced patterns

## Implementation Highlights

The technical implementation demonstrates advanced programming capabilities:

* Event-driven architecture that hooks into the game's dialogue system without performance impact
* Persistent state management for maintaining consistent dialogue transformations
* Specialized linguistic transformation pipeline that preserves meaning while altering syntax
* Cross-platform compatibility for both keyboard/mouse and gamepad/console interfaces

This project represents my commitment to creating thoughtful, detail-oriented systems that enhance user experiences while respecting established narrative elements.
